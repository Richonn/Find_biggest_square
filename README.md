# Find_biggest_square

The goal of this project is to find the biggest square in a map and display it.
Those maps are made of dots '.' and obstacles 'o'.

This program is devided into two parts :

- The first one is about solving premade maps (which you'll be able to find in the map folder).

- The second one is about generating and solving maps.

If you wanna see the first part, compile, put the binary with behind a map you wanna solve.

For example :
"$> ./find_square map/test"

The second part, compile, put the binary, enter the number of line (which will corespond to the nulber of lines in the map), and finally, enter a string.

For example :
"$> ./find_square 10 "...ooo...""
